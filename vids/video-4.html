  <p>My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you, Cry, and I'll give you something to cry about you little bastard! This thing comes fully loaded. AM/FM radio, reclining bucket seats, and... power windows. I gave it a cold? I gave it a virus. A computer virus.

  <p>God help us, we're in the hands of engineers. This thing comes fully loaded. AM/FM radio, reclining bucket seats, and... power windows. God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys God. Man creates Dinosaurs. Just my luck, no ice.
